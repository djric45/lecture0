<h4>The Afador is a mixed breed dog–a cross between the Afghan Hound and Labrador Retriever dog breeds. Loyal, energetic, and affectionate, these pups inherited some of the best qualities from both of their parents.

Afadors are also sometimes known as the Afghan Lab. You can find these mixed breed dogs in shelters and breed specific rescues, so remember to always adopt! Don’t shop if you’re looking to add an Afador to your home!

Afadors make excellent family pets, although they do better with older children and seasoned dog owners who can give the breed the training and attention they require. Afadors also make for good guard dogs, and they’re alert to strangers. The mixed breed is very energetic and athletic, so access to a safe outdoor space is preferred.

See below for all mixed dog breed traits and facts about Afadors!
</h4>
<h1>History</h1>
<h4>The Afador is considered to be a rare mixed breed. They originated in Alaska.

When it comes to the Afador's parental heritage, the Afghan Hound is estimated to be one of the oldest breeds in the world. On the Labrador Retriever side, the breed has earned a reputation for being a great guide and working dog. It's also one of the most popular dog breeds in the United States of America.

The Afador has become known as a designer dog breed, but many of them unfortunately end up in shelters. So consider contacting your local rescue groups and shelters if you're thinking about adding the Afador to your home.</h4>
<h1>Size</h1>
<h4>The Afador is usually described as a medium-sized dog. Although, as is always the case with newer mixed dog breeds, exact size standards might vary.
Most weigh in at 50 to 75 pounds and range in height from 20 to 29 inches. Female Afadors are often noticeably smaller than their male counterparts.
</h4>
<h1>Personality</h1>
<h4>Let's get straight to the point: The Afador is a dog that has a reputation for being very tricky to train. This comes from the breed's innate intelligence, which can also result in a stubborn streak. An experienced dog owner will be better suited to correctly training the Afador. If you have young kids in the house, also beware that the athletic nature of the breed can mean that children might get knocked over or injured during play sessions with the dog.

Once properly trained, your Afador will prove to be a super loyal dog. They can perform guard duty and will bark to alert you to the presence of strangers.

Afadors also require a strict exercise routine--otherwise there's a chance they'll get used to being lazy and might pick up associated health problems. If you have a large yard, then you'll be better suited to adopting an Afador.
<h1>Healt</h1>
Afadors are generally considered to be healthy dogs, although the breed can be predisposed to some of the same conditions that the Afghan Hound and Labrador Retriever face. As always, it's important to schedule regular wellness visits with your dog's vet.

Some of the more common health problems Afadors suffer from include:
