	<h1>Pocket Beagle</h1>
	<input type=image src="Pocket.jpg" width="300" height="300">
<h4>Smaller than the average Beagle dog breed, these compact scenthounds are merry and fun-loving, but they’re still hounds and as such require patience and creative training techniques to overcome their sometimes stubborn nature.

See below for complete Pocket Beagle characteristics!
</h4>
<h1>History</h1>
<h4>The origin of the word "beagle" is uncertain. It's thought that it may have been derived from the French word begueule, meaning open throat, or from the Old English word beag, meaning small. Others think it may have come from the French word beugler, meaning to bellow, or the German word begele, meaning to scold.

The breed's history is cloudy as well because breeds as we know them today didn't really develop until the 19th century. But Greek documents from 400 B.C. describe Beagle-like dogs, and the Romans may have brought small rabbit-hunting hounds with them to England and bred them with the local hounds.

William the Conqueror reportedly brought Talbot hounds (now extinct) to England during the Norman Conquest in 1066. These dogs are thought to be the ancestors of the Beagle and the Foxhound.

Beagles became popular in England early in its history. During the reigns of Edward II (1307 AD - 1327 AD) and Henry VII (1485 AD - 1509 AD), extremely small beagles, called Glove Beagles — small enough to be held in a gloved hand — were popular. There's also mention of Singing Beagles, named for their bugling voices.

Elizabeth I (1533-1603) kept packs of Pocket Beagles who stood only 9 inches tall. These small dogs were depicted in paintings as short-legged and pointy nosed. They were used for hunting, but quickly fell out of favor because they weren't very fast.

In the 1700s, fox hunting became popular in England, and the Beagle was supplanted by the larger Foxhound. If it hadn't been for the farmers in England, Ireland, and Wales who continued to keep packs to hunt rabbit and hare, the breed might have become extinct at that time.

In the mid-1800s Reverend Phillip Honeywood established a pack of Beagles in Essex, England. These dogs are thought to be the ancestors of the modern Beagle. Rev. Honeywood bred for hunting skills, not looks. Thomas Johnson, a fellow Englishman, was responsible for breeding Beagles that were both attractive and good hunters.

At about the same time, American breeders started importing Beagles from England to improve the looks of their own dogs. Many of the English imports were bred to an average height of 15 to 17 inches at the shoulder so they could hunt fox. American breeders started breeding them to be smaller for rabbit hunting.

Of interest among these rabbit-hunters is the "Patch" Beagle strain, which was developed by Willet Randall in New York around 1880. The line is primarily white with a very large tri-colored spot. They were very popular in the 1940s and 1950s because they were able to run so fast. Today, many people call lemon and white or red and white beagles "Patch" beagles.

The American Kennel Club and the first Beagle specialty club both were founded in 1884. In that same year, the AKC began registering Beagles.

Beagles compete in one of two different height classes: Beagles 13 inches tall and under compete in the 13 inch class and Beagles between 13 and 15 inches tall compete in the 15 inch class.

The American Kennel Club does not recognize a variety called the Pocket Beagle. Technically, the Pocket Beagle qualifies as a 13-inch Beagle, which is defined by the Beagle breed standard as any Beagle that doesn't exceed 13 inches in height at the shoulder and typically weighs 15 to 18 pounds.</h4>
<h1>Size</h1>
<h4>Breeders of Pocket Beagles put their height at 7 to 12 inches and weight at 7 to 15 pounds.
</h4>
<h1>Personality</h1>
<h4>Beagles are gentle and sweet, smart and funny. They will make you laugh — that is when they're not making you cry because of their often naughty behavior. Beagle people spend a lot of time trying to outthink their dogs, and are often forced to resort to food rewards to lure their hounds into a state of temporary obedience.

As with every dog, Beagles need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences. Socialization helps ensure that your pocket Beagle puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.
<h1>Healt</h1>
As with all dog breeds, the Beagle is prone to certain genetic or environmental diseases and conditions, and Pocket Beagles have more than most.

While no dog is perfect and these ailments do not affect all Beagles, it is imperative to do your research to find a Beagle who's been bred with health in mind. A reputable breeder will be proud to discuss the steps she's taken to prevent health problems and to show you the following health certifications for a puppy's parents: Orthopedic Foundation for Animals clearances for hips, knees, heart, and thyroid, and certification from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) that the eyes are normal.

Because some health problems don't appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren't issued to dogs younger than two years old. So look for a breeder who doesn't breed her dogs until they're two or three years old. The following conditions are among those that may affect Pocket Beagles:
</h4>
<dd>
<li>Eye disorders including cherry eye, a common condition in which the gland of the third eyelid swells; glaucoma, an increase in the pressure of the fluid inside of the eye; cataracts, a clouded film over the eye lens; retinal dysplasia, a folding or displacement of the retina that can lead to blindness; and progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), a degenerative disease of the retinal visual cells, which progresses to blindness. Beagles also can suffer from Distichiasis, an abnormal growth of eyelashes on the margin of the eye, resulting in the eyelashes rubbing against the eye; and dry eye (keratoconjunctivitis sicca), dryness of the cornea and the conjunctiva. Contact your vet if you notice any redness, scarring, or excessive tearing.</li>
<li>Epilepsy, a brain disorder that causes seizures, is fairly common in Beagles.</li>
<li>Hypothyroidism, a dysfunction of the thyroid gland that causes weight gain, poor coat, reproductive problems and other issues, also is common in the breed. </li>
<li>Beagle Dwarfism, which means the dog is smaller than normal. This condition may or may not be accompanied by other physical abnormalities, such as extremely short legs.</li>
