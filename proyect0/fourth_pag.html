<h4>The Samusky is a mixed breed dog–a cross between the Samoyed and the Siberian Husky dog breeds. Highly intelligent, loyal, and good-natured, these pups inherited some of the best qualities from both of their parents.

The Samusky goes by several other names, including Samsky or simply Samoyed Husky mix. Despite their status as a designer breed, you may find these mixed breed dogs in shelters and breed specific rescues. So remember to adopt! Don’t shop!

These adorable pups make excellent dogs for people with a lot of space, such as a backyard, or for highly active urban dwellers. They are sociable and loyal, which makes them a great option for both families with children and one-or-two-person homes, as well. Samuskies don’t take well to boredom, and they can be a bit stubborn if not properly trained. If you want an active, loving dog who will just as happily snuggle with you as go on a hike with you, this may be the right dog for you!

See below for all Samusky facts and mixed dog breed characteristics!
</h4>
<h1>History</h1>
<h4>The Samusky mixed dog breed may have existed naturally over the years, given the fact that both the Siberian Husky and the Samoyed can trace their roots back to northern Russia. Designer breeders likely started intentionally the Siberian Husky and the Samoyed sometime in the late 1990s in North America.

Breeders wanted to mix the two parent breeds to keep the Siberian Husky's loyalty and endurance and the Samoyed's sociable attitude. The two dogs do have many similarities, and combining the two breeds gives Samusky owners the best of both worlds. Breeders continued to create Samusky puppies as demand for the mixed breed climbed.

Even though the Samusky breed got their start as a designer breed, some have ended up in shelters or in the care of rescue groups. If you decide the Samusky is the breed for you, consider adoption.

Check your local shelters, look up Samusky rescues, or even check with breed specific Siberian Husky or Samoyed rescues, as they often take in mixed breed dogs and find homes for them.</h4>
<h1>Size</h1>
<h4>As the Samusky is a relatively new breed, there are few standards when it comes to size. That said, as a mix between two similar dogs, the Siberian Husky and the Samoyed, you can expect Samuskies to be on the medium to large side.

Most weigh in at 45 to 60 pounds and range in height from 20 to 24 inches at the shoulder. That said, many can be smaller or larger than average.
</h4>
<h1>Personality</h1>
<h4>Many Samusky enthusiasts describe these dogs' personalities as spunky, loyal, and outgoing. They may be a medium-sized dog, but that won't stop the Samusky from thinking they're a lap dog and popping right on your lap.

Having said that, they have high energy levels and can become bored easily, so they will need lots of mentally stimulating activities, or they will invent their own ways to stay entertained; many Samusky lovers say these dogs tend to be quite the escape artists when bored.

Some Samusky dogs might have a prey drive, though most seem to have lost the hunting tendencies of both their parents. This doesn't mean that they won't dart after a squirrel across the street, as they are still highly inquisitive dogs. Samusky pups need humans that keep a very close eye on them.

While the Samusky makes an amazing family dog, they do tend to pick a favorite and stick with them. That isn't to say that your Samusky won't be affectionate with everyone, though. Samuskies can thrive in both one-person homes and families alike, as long as they are getting enough exercise and stimulation.
<h1>Healt</h1>
The Samusky mixed breed is predisposed to some of the same conditions and ailments that the Siberian Husky and Samoyed also face. While most Samusky dogs are generally healthy, some may be prone to a few health issues, which is why it is important to go to routine checkups with the veterinarian and to regularly practice healthy habits.

Some of the more common health problems Samuskys suffer from include:
